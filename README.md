# blank-bootstrap
For developers' foundation

Dupe this for quick new projects :D

GitHub link is: https://github.com/nobodyrandom/blank-bootstrap.git

To clone into a new repo use:

1. Create new git repo on github
2. `git clone https://github.com/nobodyrandom/blank-bootstrap.git projectName`
3. `git remote rm origin`
4. `git remote add origin https://github.com/nobodyrandom/NAME_OF_REPO.git`
5. `git push -u origin master`

(If you are really that lazy, I've included a shell script to run step 2 onwards to set up everything. Run it using `./init.sh` on terminal. No cmd support yet)

If you would like to use quick deploy into heroku after you cloned.

Update the `app.json` and click the below button.
